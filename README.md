# RenderingEngine in C with OpenGL

#### Objectives:
   - Simple OpenGL-Wrapper functions
   - Written entirely in C
      - It really should be 100% C-Code -> sometimes github detects C++ files for whatever reason

#### Planned functionalities   
   - 2D Sprite-Renderer (X)
   - GUI (X)
   - Sandbox mode
      - Box picking and placing (X)
      - Instanced rendering (X)
      - Physics
      - Liquids   
      - AI

#### Using & Compiling
   - Clone the repository, install the dependencies (SDL2, cglm, freetype) and execute the Makefile
   - There will be a guide on how to build the whole engine when it's a bit more matured
