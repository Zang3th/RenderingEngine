# RenderingEngine in C with OpenGL

#### Objectives:
   - Simple OpenGL-Wrapper functions
   - Written entirely in C
      - It really should be 100% C-Code -> github detects some C++ files for whatever reason

#### Planned functionalities   
   - 2D Sprite-Renderer
   - GUI
   - Graph- and pointrendering
   - Sandbox mode
      - Box picking and placing
      - Physics
      - Liquids
